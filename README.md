Another regression analysis was conducted with a different dataset where the dataset was explored and encoded with Pandas before a feedforward neural network was built using Keras API within TensorFlow. The dataset that was used contained information about different variables in order to predict the burned area of forest fires. The main aim was to integrate a neural network and thereafter investigate MLflow by conducting experiments of setting up hyperparameters of batch size, epochs and neurons while adjusting them to track the results, and lastly save the model, the encoders, and the scaling in order to get the model ready for deployment.
